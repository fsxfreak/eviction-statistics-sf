notes
	strip all eviction notices that are too early (<2009?)
	from notice vector, parse out early dates
	parse out into map of vector of jsonvalue = neighborhood -> evictionnotice
	create counts by looking at true
	need to get chi square area to the right 
^all done
- need to aggregate all neighborhoods of a district into one counts for later
	-d selector for district 

dater manipulation
	- remove the golden gate park because only 5 evictions
	- remove entries with no neighborhood
